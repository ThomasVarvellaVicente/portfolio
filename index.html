                <h3>NFL predictor</h3>
                <p>Created an NFL Matchup Model using Deep Learning to predict individual player performance based on box office statistics. Delivered confidence intervals for metrics like total yards, rushing yards, and yards after catch. Built with Python, PyTorch, Flask, PostgreSQL, and MatPlotLib for accurate predictions and seamless functionality.</p>

                <h3>Computational Complexity of Sudoku</h3>
                <p>Explored the computational complexity of Sudoku, focusing on its generalization to n√ón grids and its classification as NP-complete through reductions from Latin Square Completion. This research connects Sudoku's theoretical underpinnings to broader combinatorial problems and highlights its implications for computational problem-solving.</p>

                <h3>Do Noun Classes Have a Semantic Basis, A Multilingual Analysis with Machine Learning</h3>
                <p>Conducted a multilingual analysis of noun class systems using machine learning to investigate their semantic basis. By applying FastText word embeddings and spectral clustering across 50+ languages, the research revealed nuanced overlaps and distinctions in the semantic spaces of noun classes. This work contributes to understanding the semantic underpinnings of grammatical gender and its implications for language acquisition and change.</p>
